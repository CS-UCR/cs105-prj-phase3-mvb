    "My first question/hypothesis I have about my data is what types of features relate to the number of playoff wins on the current season based on the stats of the regular season and possibly overall totals on coaches previous playoff stats and records. The next question/hypothesis is determining whether or not I can build an efficient model to determine a coaches playoff performance, possibly win percent or number of games they'll win in that current playoff season. This hypothesis will be determined on a specific coach that has a variety of years of stats to use. "

Some of the coefficients are data on the total wins the coach currently has, to different things like the coaches total playoff games coached and number of total games and wins and such. From phase 2, using EDA we found out that the win_percent column is negatively skewed, so in the testing of coefficients I squared the column to normalize the values and created a new column for it, and it gave us the best related coefficient to the number of current playoff season wins.

We build a pipeline with standard scaler for data and using a SGD regressor to fit the data and perform the gradient descent to minimize error. On the entire dataset, a 5 fold cross validation is ran, and the 5 RMSE's are calculated for the 5 fold cross validation. After squaring the RMSE to get the MSE, the MSE mean and median is around 0.21 . That is a small and good margin of error considering that our prediction values are within the range of 0 to 16. The single sample prediction we observe in the ran code seems very close to the actual value, having not too bad of an error margin."

    "I wanted to look more specifically on the coaches, so the last block of code are individualized linear regression models for coaches Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, and Pat Riley. I decided to do cross-validation for all the models, and ran 3 fold cross validation for all 3 models. I decided to re use the same features from the second model that took the better features from the first model analyzing coefficients, except this time I included features tot_pl_wins and removed the columns of Coaches that were changed from categorical to one hot encoding which is no longer needed for analyzing a single coach. After running the models and looking at their MSE's, we can see the most accurate of the models is the one correlating to Gregg Popovich, having the smallest MSE. Pat Riley comes next, with Phil Jackson is last. Jackson may be last only because he had the least amount of seasons coached, but only fall 3 seasons short from the next least # of coach seasons."
